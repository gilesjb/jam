/**
 * Jam Project interfaces and reference types.
 * The Project interfaces define utility methods and default build targets and can be used as parents of build scripts.
 * <p>
 * These types are defined in the default (unnamed) package so that scripts can use them
 * without needing to use {@code import} statements.
